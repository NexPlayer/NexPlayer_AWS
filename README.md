# NexPlayer AWS Integration Guide

In order to use NexPlayerâ€™s streaming capabilities in your NexPlayer project, you will need to have a video player stack which can stream in formats compatible with your target devices. In this guide we will set up a new Mpeg Dash stream for playback on a mobile device. We will use a few different services for this, including a subset of Amazon Web Services AWS.
